### **Technologies & Approach**

I selected the following technologies to ensure development efficiency and maintainability:

- **Python**

  The backend is developed using Python. This project served as part of my technical training and skill development.

- **SQLite3**

  I chose SQLite3 for its ease of setup and the convenience of writing SQL queries (such as SELECT statements) directly within the code.
