### **Technologies and Techniques**

The following technologies were adopted in development to improve efficiency and maintainability.

- **Astro**

  By adopting the static site generator **Astro**, page loading speed is maximized. It also enables efficient, component-based development and a clean, easy-to-understand URL structure.

  The utility-first framework **Tailwind CSS** was introduced. This moves away from traditionally cumbersome CSS management, achieving both rapid styling and efficient maintenance with **minimal code**.
