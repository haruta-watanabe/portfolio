### **Technologies Used and Innovations**

In development, we adopted the following technologies to improve efficiency and maintainability.

- **Astro**

  By adopting the static site generator **Astro**, we have maximized page display speed. It also enables efficient component-based development and a clean, easy-to-understand URL design.

- **Tailwind CSS**

  We introduced **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first framework. This allows us to move away from traditionally cumbersome CSS management, achieving both rapid styling and efficient maintenance with **minimal code**.
