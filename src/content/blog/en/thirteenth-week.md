# A Major Milestone: Completing CS50x

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the significant delay in this post.

The 13th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. This was a commemorative week, as I finished running the course of a major learning curriculum.

## Week 13 Reflection

This week, continuing from last week, I poured all my energy into creating the final project for **CS50x** (Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science).

With the submission deadline approaching on December 31st (January 1st, 8:59 a.m. JST), it was a tense week where I was making adjustments until the very last minute. However, it was worth the effort, as I **successfully submitted the final project and completed CS50x!**

Completing this globally acclaimed CS course has not only given me technical confidence but has also become a great source of encouragement for continuing my studies.

## Week 14 Goals

In week 14, now that my resources have freed up following the completion of CS50x, I will begin working on the Matsuo Lab (GCI) final project in earnest.

- **Create a Prototype for the GCI Final Project**
  - My goal is to build the entire system as a first draft, without worrying too much about minute precision at first.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
