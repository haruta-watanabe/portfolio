# Return to CS Fundamentals and Pursuit of Model Accuracy

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

The 10th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded.
Starting this week, I have newly begun taking **CS50x** (Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science). Balancing this with the Matsuo Lab (GCI) lectures was tough, but it became a very dense and meaningful learning period.

## Week 10 Reflection

The highlights of this week are the following two points:

1.  **Learning Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - I learned parameter adjustment techniques to maximize model prediction accuracy to the limit, improving my practical analysis skills.
2.  **Systematizing CS Fundamentals with CS50x**
    - I have started learning Computer Science in earnest. The process of having concepts I previously grasped as a "feeling" through my development experience now being "verbalized and systematized" as theory is very interesting, and I am progressing with a deep sense of understanding.

## Week 11 Goals

In week 11, I will proceed with both deepening my foundation and working on practical assignments.

1.  **Strengthening Algorithms and CS Fundamentals**
    - Through CS50x, I will solidify my knowledge of algorithms and computer science, which are the roots of programming.
2.  **Working on the GCI Final Project**
    - Toward the completion of the Matsuo Lab (GCI) course, I will secure ample time to work on the final assignment and start creating the deliverables.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
