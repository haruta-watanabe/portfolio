# The Chain of Corrections and Commitment to Quality

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the significant delay in this post.

The 15th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. This week, I spent a lot of time polishing the final project for the Matsuo Lab (GCI).

## Week 15 Reflection

This week, I worked on fixing and improving the GCI final project prototype I created last week.

I initially planned for minor corrections, but I fell into a **"chain of corrections"** where fixing one thing revealed another area for improvement, and I was unable to bring it to a final form that I was satisfied with.

However, I view this as a necessary process to create a better product. While I was able to maintain my attention to detail, I could not complete the task, so challenges remain in terms of time management.

## Week 16 Goals

In week 16, I will make **"Submission"** my absolute goal.

- **Submission of the GCI Final Project**
  - I will put an end to the corrections and improvements, finalize the deliverable, and submit it. Recognizing that "finishing" is also an important skill, I will make the final sprint.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
