# Balancing Exam Periods and Learning Pandas

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

The fifth week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. It was a busy week, overlapping with my university's term exams, but I was able to plan my time effectively and continue my studies meaningfully.

## Week 5 Reflection

The biggest topic this week was starting to learn the data analysis library **"Pandas."**

Combined with "Numpy," which I learned in week 4, the core tools for data science are beginning to come together, and I have a strong sense that my learning is finally getting serious.

It was not easy to secure study time due to university exams, but being able to find time and continue learning even in that situation has given me confidence.

## Week 6 Goals

In week 6, while continuing to focus on the Python libraries I've learned so far (Numpy, Pandas), I will also begin learning the data visualization library **"Matplotlib."**

I will move beyond just "manipulating" data to acquire skills in "visualizing" it, thereby expanding the scope of my analysis.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
