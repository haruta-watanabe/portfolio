# Prioritizing Academics and Preparing for the Next Implementation

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the delay in this post.

The 17th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. This week was spent concentrating my resources on my university academics, which is my primary duty as a student.

## Week 17 Reflection

This week, I had planned to start learning algorithms, but since it coincided with the peak of my university **final exams**, I was unable to secure time for studying data science.

While I feel very regretful about this, I made it my top priority to ensure I get through my academic work (Law exams) without neglecting it. I believe that judging when to "step back" like this is also important for continuing one's studies in the long run.

## Week 18 Goals

In week 18, I will make up for the stagnation caused by the exam period and proceed with both input and output in parallel.

1.  **Resume Algorithm Study**
    - I will firmly learn the basics of algorithms that I couldn't start last week.
2.  **Start Product Creation**
    - To ensure that what I've learned doesn't end as mere knowledge but takes shape as something that actually works, I will start developing a new product.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
