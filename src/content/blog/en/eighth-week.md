# Feature Engineering and Resetting Goals

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

Having stepped into the realm of data science from mobile app development, I have now completed the 8th week of my studies. As my studies progress, the content is deepening into more advanced and practical areas.

## Week 8 Reflection

This week, I learned about **"Feature Engineering,"** which significantly influences the predictive accuracy of models.

I learned the importance of the process of processing and selecting data to make it easier for models to learn, rather than using the data as is, and I once again realized the depth of data analysis.

On the other hand, regarding the participation in Kaggle that I set as a goal last week, I decided to postpone it this week to prioritize my physical condition. I want to approach it without rushing, when I am in perfect condition.

## Week 9 Goals

In week 9, I will focus on practical skill improvement once again.

1.  **Challenge Kaggle**
    - I will aim to participate in a competition again as a task I could not achieve last week.
2.  **Challenge AtCoder**
    - I plan to try competitive programming (AtCoder) to polish not only my data processing abilities but also my basic algorithm construction skills and coding speed.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
