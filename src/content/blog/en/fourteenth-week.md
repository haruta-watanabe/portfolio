# Launching the GCI Final Project Prototype

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the significant delay in this post.

The 14th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. This week was an important phase in the Matsuo Lab (GCI) final project, where I gave it a concrete form.

## Week 14 Reflection

This week, as per last week's goal, I created the **GCI Final Project Prototype (First Version)**.

I succeeded in building the entire system as a "working model" for now, but I found multiple issues regarding layout and UI/UX that need fixing. While functional implementation has progressed, it still needs polishing to raise the quality to a level suitable for submission.

## Week 15 Goals

In week 15, I will dedicate the week to finalizing the project.

- **Completion of the GCI Final Project**
  - I will fix the layout distortions and usability issues remaining in the current prototype, raise the quality to a submittable level, and complete it.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
