# Tackling Data Visualization and Seeing It Through

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

Having stepped into the realm of data science from mobile app development, I have now completed the 6th week of my studies. Although I faced some health issues this week, I mastered a key tech stack, making it a very meaningful week.

## Week 6 Reflection

This week, I worked on learning the data visualization library **"Matplotlib."**

With the addition of Matplotlib (visualization) to Numpy (numerical calculation) and Pandas (data manipulation) which I learned previously, the **"basic tools for analysis"** in data science are now all present. By handling these in combination, I feel that the content I am learning has become more practical and serious.

There were moments mid-week when I fell ill, but being able to adjust my pace and complete my tasks has led to a boost in my mental confidence.

## Week 7 Goals

In week 7, I will finally step up into the realm of **Machine Learning**.

Specifically, I will start learning about algorithms such as **"Supervised Learning."** Using the data manipulation and visualization skills I have cultivated so far as a foundation, I want to firmly solidify the basics of model building.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
