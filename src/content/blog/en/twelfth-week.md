# The Wall of English Lectures and the Final Sprint to Complete CS50x

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize again for the significant delay in this post.

The 12th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. Just like last week, this week was dedicated entirely to taking **CS50x** (Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science) as the deadline approaches.

## Week 12 Reflection

This week as well, I concentrated almost all my learning resources on CS50x.

Since the curriculum moved from the C language to familiar territory like **Python**, my technical understanding went smoothly. However, because the lectures are entirely in **English**, there were moments where I felt the "language barrier" separate from the technical content, making it a study period that required high levels of concentration.

## Week 13 Goals

In week 13, I aim to finally complete CS50x and return to my data science studies.

1.  **Completion of CS50x and Submission of Final Project**
    - I will make a final sprint, complete and submit the final project, and finish CS50x.
2.  **Resuming the Matsuo Lab GCI Final Project**
    - As soon as I finish CS50x, I will immediately shift back to working on the Matsuo Lab (GCI) final project, which I had paused, and catch up on the delay.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
