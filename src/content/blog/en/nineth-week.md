# Unsupervised Learning and Strengthening the Engineering Perspective

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

Having stepped into the realm of data science from mobile app development, I have now completed the 9th week of my studies. Although my days are busy balancing this with lectures, I was able to have a very meaningful week of learning again.

## Week 9 Reflection

This week, I learned about **"Unsupervised Learning,"** another major pillar of machine learning. Learning methods for datasets that do not have labeled data has further expanded my analytical approach.

I also started challenging myself with **AtCoder (Competitive Programming)**, which was one of my goals. Although I postponed participating in Kaggle due to time constraints, touching upon algorithms through AtCoder sparked a strong desire to "improve my coding skills further" this week.

## Week 10 Goals

In week 10, in addition to data analysis skills, I will strengthen my perspective on **Software Engineering**.

1.  **Deep Dive into Python and Algorithms**
    - Conscious of my growing interest in the field of software engineering, I will learn deeper language specifications of Python and efficient algorithm construction methods.
2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - To maximize the performance of the models I create, I will master parameter adjustment techniques (tuning) and aim to improve model accuracy.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
