# The Joy of Connecting Knowledge and a Step Toward Practice

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

Having stepped into the realm of data science from mobile app development, I have now completed the 7th week of my studies. This week, I touched upon the core of data science and was able to have a more fulfilling learning experience than ever before.

## Week 7 Reflection

This week, I finally started learning **"Supervised Learning."**

The process of building models by mobilizing all the knowledge I've built up so far—Numpy (numerical calculation), Pandas (data organization), and Matplotlib (visualization)—and actually writing and running code was extremely stimulating. I became so engrossed that I felt it was **"incredibly fun."**

Although it was a busy week in my private life with volunteer circle activities, the interesting nature of the learning content served as motivation, and I was able to run through to the end while maintaining a high level of enthusiasm.

## Week 8 Goals

In week 8, I will focus on transforming the knowledge I've acquired into more practical skills.

Specifically, while deepening the basic knowledge of machine learning I've learned so far, I also want to challenge myself in practical arenas like **Kaggle** (data analysis competitions) to improve the quality of my output.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
