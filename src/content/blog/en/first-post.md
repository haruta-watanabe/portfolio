## Welcome to My Portfolio Site!

This is my first blog post. I'm excited to announce the launch of my new portfolio site, created to showcase my skills and past work.

This site was built from scratch using a modern tech stack: **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**. Thanks to Astro's high-speed performance and the efficient styling provided by Tailwind CSS, I believe I've created a smooth browsing experience.

I'm also using the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin to format blog posts. This automatically converts text written in Markdown, like this post, into a readable and beautiful layout.

### Key Features

I've implemented several key features on this site:

- **Fast Loading Speeds**

  Thanks to Astro's static site generation, the site achieves extremely fast page loads.

- **Dark Mode Support**

  Users can switch between light and dark modes to suit their preference.

- **Multilingual Support**

  The site automatically switches between Japanese and English based on the browser's language settings. (Manual switching is also available.)

- **Responsive Design**

  The layout is optimized for all devices, from PCs to smartphones.

In the future, I plan to use this blog to share my learning journey and any technical discoveries I make during development.

I hope this portfolio site helps you get a better understanding of who I am and what I can do. Please take your time and look around.
