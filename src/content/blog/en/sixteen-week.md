# Submission of GCI Final Project and the Trial of Final Exams

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the delay in this post.

The 16th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. This week marked a significant milestone as I submitted the final project for the Matsuo Lab (GCI), which I have been working on for a long time.

## Week 16 Reflection

This week, I successfully completed the **submission of the GCI final project** as planned. I am relieved to have shaped the culmination of my studies so far and submitted it.

On the other hand, regarding the entry for the "Certification of Excellence" which I was aiming for in parallel, I missed the submission deadline while concentrating on preparing for university final exams, and was unable to apply.
I feel regret over my poor schedule management, but I will accept the fact that I was able to fulfill the "project submission required for completion" and move forward.

## Week 17 Goals

In week 17, I will shift from the implementation phase of project creation back to the phase of solidifying the foundation.

- **Learning Algorithms**
  - Building on CS50x and my implementation experience so far, I will deepen my knowledge of algorithms, which is essential for writing efficient and beautiful code.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
