# Taking on LeetCode and a New Perspective

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

While I usually develop mobile apps and websites, as I mentioned last week, I have now completed the 19th week of my studies with a clear view towards a career as a data scientist and, newly, as a **"Software Engineer."**

## Week 19 Reflection

This week, as planned, I proceeded with learning algorithms and also started challenging myself on the global platform, **LeetCode**.

Unlike the "function construction to realize features" that I do in everyday app development, LeetCode demands dealing with "execution time limits" and "the search for more efficient algorithms in terms of memory and processing speed." I felt that it required a completely different way of using my brain compared to my previous development work, allowing me to touch upon the depth of software engineering.

## Week 20 Goals

In week 20, I will proceed with practical training and output development in parallel.

1.  **Continue Learning Algorithms and LeetCode**
    - While continuing to deepen my knowledge of algorithms, I will train my "thinking process for writing efficient code" through LeetCode.
2.  **Start the Capstone Project (Visualization App)**
    - I will finally begin developing the "product that visualizes algorithms" that I had envisioned as the culmination of my algorithm studies thus far, giving shape to the knowledge I have acquired.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
