# Path to a Data Scientist: Balancing University, and Moving on to Statistics (Week 3)

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

I have now completed the third week of my studies to become a data scientist. This week required some creativity to secure study time while balancing it with my university classes, but I was able to have a very fulfilling week of learning.

## Week 3 Reflection

My university studies were busy this week, and there were moments when it was difficult to secure time for data science.

However, because the content I am studying (Python, SQL, Mathematics) is something I genuinely enjoy and it satisfies my own intellectual curiosity, I was able to have fun and make progress even while busy. Being able to continue learning positively under difficult circumstances was a major achievement.

## Week 4 Goals

In week 4, in addition to continuing my studies in Python, SQL, and mathematics, I will also begin a new core area of data science: **Statistics**.

I am gradually moving into more specialized territory, but I will continue to build my knowledge steadily without neglecting the fundamentals.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
