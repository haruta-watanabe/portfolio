# Deepening Algorithms and Concepts for Visualization

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the delay in this post.

The 18th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. My studies were interrupted last week due to my university's exam period, but I successfully resumed them this week and focused on acquiring foundational theories.

## Week 18 Reflection

This week, I worked on learning **algorithms** as planned.

As I progressed with my studies, instead of merely acquiring knowledge as input, an idea emerged for an output that leverages my background in app development. Specifically, as a culmination of my learning, I would like to create **"a product that visualizes the behavior of algorithms."**

I envision that visually representing abstract logic will not only solidify my own understanding but also serve as a useful tool for others.

## Week 19 Goals

In week 19, I will continue my input and challenge myself on a new platform.

1.  **Continue learning algorithms**
    - I will continue to deeply learn the theories that will form the foundation for the visualization.
2.  **Challenge LeetCode**
    - To measure my algorithm implementation skills at a global standard level, I want to try coding platforms like **LeetCode** and cultivate practical problem-solving abilities.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Additionally, moving forward, I will also consider a career plan as a software engineer, not just a data scientist (as my recent activities and interests are strongly leaning in that direction).

Thank you for your continued support.
