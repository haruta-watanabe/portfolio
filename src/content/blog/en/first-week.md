# The Beginning of My Learning Journey

Hello everyone, my name is Haruta Watanabe.

My first week of studying to become a data scientist has just finished. As someone who usually develops mobile apps, web apps, and websites, it was exciting to dive back into **Python** after about a year away from it, having recently focused on technologies like **Flutter (Dart)** and **HTML**.

## Week 1 Review

A significant portion of my first week was dedicated to creating a portfolio site, setting up various accounts, and managing my university coursework. Despite the busy schedule, I was fortunate to connect with many people, which made for a very stimulating and rewarding week.

## Goals for Week 2

To shake off the rust, my main goal for the second week is to strengthen my foundational skills by thoroughly reviewing the basics of **Python**. In addition, I plan to begin studying:

- **Linear Algebra**
- **Statistics**

I plan to post a reflection on the previous week and my goals for the current week every Monday.
I look forward to sharing my progress with you all.
