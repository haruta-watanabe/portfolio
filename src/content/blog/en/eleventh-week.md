# Intensive CS50x Study and the Challenge of C Language

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I deeply apologize for the significant delay in this post.

The 11th week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. This week was spent concentrating my resources on taking **CS50x** (Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science), as the deadline was approaching.

## Week 11 Reflection

Since the completion deadline for CS50x was approaching on **January 1st**, I needed to proceed with the course at a furious speed, so I spent most of my study time on this course.

The content centered on fundamental concepts of computer science, but handling the **C language** for the first time was a particularly big challenge. Although it took time to get used to concepts such as memory management and syntax that differ from modern languages like Python, it was a valuable experience to write code in a way that is closer to the operating principles of computers.

## Week 12 Goals

In week 12, I will make completing CS50x my main task, while simultaneously re-accelerating my data science studies (Matsuo Lab GCI).

1.  **Continuing CS50x**
    - I will make a last spurt towards the deadline and complete the assignments.
2.  **Progressing with Matsuo Lab GCI Studies**
    - Since I concentrated my resources on CS50x, I will adjust the balance of my data science studies and steadily proceed with the GCI curriculum.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
