# The Synergy of Self-Study and Lectures

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

First, I apologize for the delay in posting this week's reflection.

The fourth week of my studies to become a data scientist has concluded. The main theme this week was balancing the GCI lectures I just started with my ongoing self-study.

## Week 4 Reflection

This week, I began taking the GCI lectures in earnest.

Balancing self-study and lecture tasks was challenging time-wise, but more importantly, it was a week where I strongly felt the value of **"learning systematically from an instructor."**

In particular, when I received explanations from the instructor on topics I had been studying on my own, my ambiguous knowledge became organized, and my understanding deepened significantly. The input from self-study and the systematic input from lectures are beginning to create an **ideal synergistic effect**, making my learning extremely meaningful.

## Week 5 Goals

In week 5, I will focus on the following two points to solidify this new positive learning cycle:

1.  **Ensure thorough comprehension of GCI lecture content**
    - My top priority will be to get into the rhythm of the lectures, which are a new pillar of my learning, and not neglect assignments or reviews.
2.  **Reinforce the fundamentals of Python and SQL**
    - While learning new concepts in lectures, I will use my self-study time to focus on strengthening my foundational skills in Python and SQL, which are the "hands and feet" of data science.

## Going Forward

I will continue to post a summary of my previous week's reflection and my goals for the current week every Monday.

Thank you for your continued support.
