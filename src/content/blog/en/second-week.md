# Path to a Data Scientist: Intensifying Studies and Balancing Time (Week 2)

Hello, this is Haruta Watanabe.

While I usually develop mobile and web apps, I have started studying to pursue a career as a data scientist and have just completed my second week.

## Week 2 Reflection

This week, not only did I get my bearings back with Python, which I haven't used in a while, but I also began studying mathematics in earnest.

It was a difficult week to find study time, as I was also juggling another task: preparing for university selection exams. However, I never felt that studying was a "chore." Instead, I felt like I had entered a new phase, distinct from "app development," and I was able to enjoy it as an intellectual pursuit.

## Week 3 Goals

For the third week, I aim to achieve the following two goals:

1.  **Thoroughly master the fundamentals of Python and SQL**
    - I will establish a solid foundation in data manipulation techniques, which are the bedrock of data science.
2.  **Efficiently study mathematics and statistics**
    - To achieve maximum results in a limited time, I will search for and maintain efficient study methods.

## Going Forward

I plan to post a summary like this every Monday, reflecting on the previous week and setting goals for the current one.

Thank you for your continued support.
